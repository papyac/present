## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
a0 <- 1
a0
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot
```{r}
 cel <- c((15-32)/1.8 , (-10-32)/1.8)
cel
```

```{r}
vec200 <- c(1:200)%% 2
vec200
```
```{r}
numperfect <- round(sqrt(1001)-1)
numperfect
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
mpg
```
```{r}
# to get the 3 most fuel-efficient models in terms of highway we con
```
```{r}
#1
top3 <- tail(mpg[with(mpg, order(mpg$cty, mpg$hwy)),],3)
```
```{r}
#1
numCompact <- dim (mpg[mpg$class == "compact",])[1]
numCompact
```
```{r}
#3
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=cty, y=hwy)) + geom_point()
```
```{r}
#4
ggplot (data = mpg, aes(x=factor(year), y= hwy)) + geom_boxplot()
```
